## 🧑‍💻 **Introduction**
This guide provides a structured approach to understanding and memorizing relational database concepts and SQL commands. Use it as a quick reference or study resource for core topics.

## 📂 **Database Basics**
Covers what databases are, types of Database Management Systems (DBMS), and why databases are essential for organized data storage and management.

## 🔗 **RDBMS Overview**
Introduces **Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)**, explaining table structures, columns, rows, and their interrelationships. This section is essential for grasping the foundation of data organization.

## 🔑 **Keys and Relationships**
Summarizes the different types of keys (primary, foreign) and their roles in relational databases. Understanding these keys is crucial for mastering data linking and integrity concepts.

## 📊 **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**
ERDs are visual tools to plan database structures. This section outlines ERD basics and relationships between entities, helping in visualizing and structuring data.

## 📜 **SQL Command Types**
Breaks down SQL into different command categories for easy memorization:
- **DDL** (Data Definition Language): Commands like `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP` for defining database structures.
- **DML** (Data Manipulation Language): Commands like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` for modifying data.
- **DCL** (Data Control Language): Commands like `GRANT`, `REVOKE` for access control.
- **TCL** (Transaction Control Language): Commands like `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK` for transaction management.
- **DQL** (Data Query Language): Mainly `SELECT` for querying data.

## 🛠 **Data Integrity and Normalization**
Focuses on concepts like normalization to reduce data redundancy and integrity rules that ensure data accuracy and consistency.

## 💾 **Backup and Restore Procedures**
These are the basic commands for database backup, differential backup, and restore. Knowing these ensures that data can be safely preserved and recovered.

## ⚙️ **Constraints and Indexing**
Overview of constraints (primary key, foreign key, unique, etc.) to enforce data rules and indexing techniques for faster data retrieval.

## 📌 **Usage**
This guide is structured for easy reference and memorization of SQL and database concepts. Ideal for preparing for exams, interviews, or refreshing core database knowledge.
